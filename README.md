# Gallery App with ReactJS and Firebase

I created a Gallery App using ReactJS + Vite and Firebase for Sign-in, Sign-out, and image upload features. 
Before users can upload images, they are required to Sign-in first. If they don't have an account, they need to Sign-up and will be redirected to the Sign-in form. Additionally, I utilized the Masonry library to create a grid layout similar to the one on the Unsplash website. I used sample images from the Unsplash and Wallpaperflare websites. 

The purpose of creating this Gallery App was to learn how to implement Firebase for authentication and file storage!
